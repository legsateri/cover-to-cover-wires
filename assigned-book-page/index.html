            <p>I never would have thought a great grandmother's experience would still causing trauma to her great
                granddaughter. -T-Money</p>
            <p>I definitely think a relative's experience during the Holocaust could emotionally effect the family
                through the generations. But does anyone else think that the language she was using to describe her
                anxiety was coincidental? I use similar words to describe mine and no one in my family had that
                experience. I think the point he's trying to make is valid but his evidence doesn't hold weight.
